# ATM_FileHandling
This repository contains a C program that simulates an ATM system with file handling capabilities. The program allows users to create accounts, read account information, deposit or withdraw funds, and delete accounts. Account information, including account number, PIN, balance, and transaction dates, is stored in the "account.dat" file.
